# BalanceMe


> BalanceMe is an application which gives the user the ability to control his incomes/spendings and keep track of
the user's financial balance over time. The user allocates a budget and at the end of the month, the application reports to the user about his spending habits and whether the user spent over budget or not.


## Motivation


* *For many people in the world, keeping track of their budget every month is an impossible task. 
With a large amount of spendings and few sources of income, it might be difficult to ensure your spendings are lower than your incomes.
Sometimes, people are interested in statistics about their spending over time, in order 
to plan future spendings, save money and manage their balance. 
BalanceMe offers a user-friendly platform for managing the financial balance each month,
customized especially for every user.*
